		<div id="instructions">
			<p>When I was little, me, my mom and my sister had a "secret" language which we would speak when we didn't want anyone to understand it. We would add a "ver" prefix in front of every word and say it so fast that sometimes even we would get lost with it.
			The below exercise is a simple example of how it might work in a written form.</p>
		</div> <br>

			<textarea id="input" type="text" placeholder="Enter your text here."></textarea>
			<br>
			<p id="almost">After you click "submit" the written algorithm will run through the code, match any word and add "ver" prefix to each of the it:</p><br>
			<input id="submit" type="submit" value="Submit!" onclick="submit()"> <br>
